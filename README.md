# Its raining and my weetbix is wet. That's Camping!

Find campsites near you in New South Wales, Australia, simply and beautifully.

Works on your phone (Android or iPhone) far away from towns even when out of network range.

And it's completely free to use and open source.

## Technology

Built with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/).

## Get started with development

Install Ionic

```
npm install -g cordova ionic
```

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/mlandauer/thats-camping-3.git
cd thats-camping-3
```

Start the local development server

```
ionic serve
```

## Building for Android/iPhone

This is more complicated and I won't attempt to cover it here. Read the Ionic and Cordova documentation to get started.
